# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: parameters are identified with () the arguments are held within the parameter.

Researched answer: Argurments are a value the is passed to a function. Whereas a parameter is the given name for a functions definition.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: I am not sure exactly what this question is asking. However, if I can refer to my notes, I'd love to get back with you with a clear answer to your question. 

Researched answer: The predefined parameters of the .map() method are (value, index, array) they can all be named anything that the person writing the code wants, however, the order always remains the same. Of the three the only one that is required is value. Both index and array are optional.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: When you use the .map() high order function it will return a new array. When you use the .filter() high order function it will not create a new array however it will pull from the current array for whatever was filtered.

Researched answer: I guess I was wrong about the .filter() it does in fact return a new array, however the new array only returns the values that satisfy the conditon that was being evaluated. The .map() will return a new array of the same length.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: An iteration is function that will repeat over and over until a condition has been met.

Researched answer: Also known as a for loop, it will repeat a code so the code does not have to be rewritten over and over until a condition has been met. When the condition has been met, the iteration will end.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: The class is like the ingredient to make something, it tells you what steps to take, and what process to follow. The object the end result of the class.

Researched answer: Classes are blueprints of objects, they contain data and behavior and are a function. Objects are variables that will reference the class it has been assigned.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I am unfamiliar with this term, please allow me to get back with you on this.

Researched answer: It is a process where, prior to executing a code, an interpreter moves the declaration of functions, variable or class. It will move it to the top of its scope. Hoisting will allow a function within a code to be safely used before it is declared.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: it is a description of software system features. Presented in the perspective of the user in an informal way.

2. Spread operator: it expands arrays into individual elements.

3. React: React is used for creating user interfaces. 

4. React props: Passes intformation from one component to another using specialized React objects.

5. DOM events: Not sure if this is what you are asking for, but what I found is that DOM stands for (Document Object Model) and it signals that something can be triggered by a user or that something has occurred or something is occurring. For example clicking a mouse.
